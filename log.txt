! "heroku create mr-cocktail-tomgauth --region eu" => command not found 'heroku'
$ I had to install heroku
! How to draw a database with data relationships
  ? CHeck the slides
$ Done
- Not sure what to do with the database for now.
- Moving on
! "Validate all models tests before moving to the routing layer."
  ? Create models first
    ? check the slides and create models for cocktails, ingredients and doses
    - rails generate model Cocktail name:string
    $ worked
  $
$
! I need to add things to the models
  ? Can I do it without doing a migration
    - I think I can, let's try
    $ working
  $
$
! Controller should exist for cocktails and Doses
  ? check the slides for the right syntax
  - Controller created but weird shit with the rake file. It seems that a method that I used is deprecated. Let's get some small wins elsewhere

! Dose 'should have a description'
  ? redo the migration of Dose adding a description
  ! "relation 'doses' already exist"
  $ Ticket
$ Solved : needed to drop the database before
